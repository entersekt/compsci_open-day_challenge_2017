The Entersekt 2017 Computer Science Coding Challenge
---
Welcome to Entersekt's 2017 Coding Challenge for students of Stellenbosch University's Computer Science Department. This challenge is similar to the assessments used to evaluate whether potential candidates have the fundamental technical ability to be successful as developers at Entersekt.

# Instructions
1. Write a small cross-platform program in Java 8 that exposes a RESTful interface on port 8080 and allows a client application to do only one thing: obtain the full directory listing of a given directory path on the local filesystem. Include the full path, file size and attribute information in the result and cater for a directory size of at least 1 000 000.
2. Refer to [What is Docker?](https://www.docker.com/what-docker) and the [Dockerfile Reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/). Create a _Dockerfile_ that will allow one to use the "_docker build_" command on a Linux or Mac OS X machine to create a container distribution of your program. 

# Submission Guidelines
* We recommend making use of the *openjdk* base image at [https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk/](https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk/) to derive your _Dockerfile_ from.
* Add a _README.md_ file with the necessary steps on how to compile your program, build the container, run it and then consume your REST service.
* Submit the source code along with build instructions to your personal account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) (if you don't have an account, create one – it's free) and email the URL to careers@entersekt.com with the subject "*Entersekt 2017 Computer Science Coding Challenge*". Please remember to also include your contact details in the e-mail. 
* The cut-off time for your submission is *10am on Monday, the 11th of September 2017*.
* You may leverage any resources at your disposal to complete the project but you may not outsource your work.
* We will evaluate all aspects of the submitted work when making our decision. Please note that our decision is final. Winners will be announced on 29 September 2017.
